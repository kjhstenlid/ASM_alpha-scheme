Scripts written 2019-2021 by Tej Choksi (NTU and SUNCAT SLAC/Stanford)
 with help from Verena Streibel (SUNCAT SLAC/Stanford)
 and Joakim Halldin Stenlid (SUNCAT SLAC/Stanford)

The scripts execute a microkinetic model for NO decomposition over Pt catalysts
 that is described in the paper
 'Assessing Catalytic Rates of Bimetallic Nanoparticles with Active Site Specificity - A
  Case Study using NO Decomposition'
 with authors Joakim Halldin Stenlid, Verena Streibel, Tej Choksi, Frank Abild-Pedersen
 currently under revision (Oct 2021)

The scripts are distributed in folders based on temperature and site
 Temperatures (700K, 900K)
 Sites (7-7, 8-8, 9-9-9)

In the folder 700/9-9-9/ there are additional scripts for performing analysis of kinetic
 metrics: apparent activation energy, degree of rate control, rate orders

For each folder, there are is a run.py script that runs the microkinetic model
 syntax: python3 run.py

The first part of the run.py script can be modified to adjust the conditions and/or site 

All files also contain example output files in .cvs format
