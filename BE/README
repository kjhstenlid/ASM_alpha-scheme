str2alpha+BE.py is a script for analyzing binding energy and coordination vector for
Pt surface sites of bimetallic nanoparticles

alpha+BE_cubo561.data is the output of using the above script for a cuboctahedral Pt561,
with structure in POSCAR_CUBO_561 (VASP format)

use: python3 str2alpha+BE.py POSCAR_CUBO_561 > alpha+BE_cubo561.data
to obtain the same data with the Atomic simulation environment (ASE) and ASAP3 installed
