# ASM_alpha-scheme
Scripts related to the Alloy stability model (ASM), aslo known as the alpha parameter scheme, for evaluating local stability and activity of metal catalytic sites

The BE folder contains script for analyzing the binding energy and coordination
vectors of Pt sites on bimetallic nanoparticles using the ASM / alpha parameter scheme model

The mkm folder contains scripts for solving a microkinetic model for NO decomposition
using the binding energy as descriptor
